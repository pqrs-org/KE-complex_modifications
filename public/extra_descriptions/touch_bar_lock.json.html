  In MacBooks with a Touch Bar, holding down the <code>fn</code> function key
  usually changes its behaviour. For instance, it might show the
  Control Strip by default, and holding down would instead show the
  <code>F1</code>-<code>F12</code> function keys.

  This modification takes that idea further, by using the combination
  <code>⇧fn</code> as a hard toggle, like <code>⇪</code> Caps Lock is to <code>⇧</code> Shift.
