  This rule is handy when you are used to or would like to use

    the US English Layout
  </a>
  but have one of
  <a

    the layouts with the big Return key
  </a>

  You can remap the <span class="monospace">backslash (\)</span> key
  to <span class="monospace">return_or_enter</span> with a <em>Simple Modification</em>
  and then enable this <em>Complex Modification</em> to make your backslash and pipe keys accessible
  when you press your right Command (⌘).
