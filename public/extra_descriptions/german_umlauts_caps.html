<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Use the Caps Lock key as a modifier key, but for getting access to the German letters.</p>
<p>Easy access to äöü, ÄÖÜ, and ß.</p>
<p>All of the rules are toggleable on/off</p>
<p>BE AWARE, there is a rule to disable use of the Caps Lock key.</p>

<h5>What Keyboards are Supported</h5>
<p>Any keyboard with the standard Latin characterset is supported. The purpose of this modification is to enable use of the German characters on a keyboard that doesn't have them.</p>
<p>As long as you have a Caps Lock key, as well as [aous], you're good to go.</p>
<p>That said, it's limited to ANSI or ISO keyboards with an English input language.</p>

<h5>Motivation</h5>

<p>I don't like the press-and-hold default system for getting access to the German characters. On Windows, I had used AutoHotKey to create a script that disables the caps lock key, and uses it as amodifier to get access to the characters. I ported that over to my new macOS machine.</p>
