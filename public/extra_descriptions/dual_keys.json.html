<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Using the Shift keys as a dual keys is mainly intended for keyboards that let you access them
    with your thumbs. You can use them on regular keyboard, too, but you won't to get as much
    benefit from it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Likewise, if your Control keys are located on the outer edges of your keyboard (because it has
    a wide spacebar), then it's not recommendeded to use them as dual keys.
  </li>
