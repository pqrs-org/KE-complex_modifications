<h3>Dual keys</h3>

<p>
  Relieve stress from you pinkies by moving <code>Escape</code>, <code>Enter</code>,
  <code>-</code>, <code>=</code>, <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> to the modifier keys, without
  losing the ability to use them as modifier keys.
</p>
<p>
  Note: Using Shift as a dual key is mainly intended for keyboards that let you use Shift with your
  thumbs. You can still use it on regular keyboard, but you're not going to get as much benefit
  from it
