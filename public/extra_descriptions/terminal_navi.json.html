<p>In <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net">Zsh</a>, the command <code>backward-kill-line</code>
  does not have a keybinding by default and the shortcut for "Delete to beginning of line" will
  delete the whole line instead. To get it to work correctly,  you need to add the following to
  your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file:.</p>
<pre>bindkey "^U" backward-kill-line</pre>
<p>If you are using
  <a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/master/modules/editor">Prezto's
  editor module</a>, then this is included automatically.</p>
