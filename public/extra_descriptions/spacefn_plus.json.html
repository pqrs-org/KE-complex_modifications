<h1 id="spacefn-plus">SpaceFN Plus</h1>

<p>This is an upgraded version of SpaceFN. The existing SpaceFN
configuration unfavourably activates SpaceFN mode during rapid typing,
rendering it unusability. The concept is drawn from <a
href="https://spacelauncherapp.com">SpaceLauncher</a>, with two primary
revisions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Inhibit SpaceFN Mode for a duration of 0.2 seconds post the last
keystroke: This adjustment allows for the quick insertion of a space
following the completion of a word.</li>
<li>Ingore pre-defined keys within 0.2 seconds after space key down:
This enhancement aims to prevent a letter from being activated before
releasing the space bar during speedy typing.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been using these two <a
href="https://gist.github.com/tshu-w/82af1843798edaab9062e44cb261d25a">improvements</a>
for 4 years, and they work well for me.</p>
<p>Known limitation: as stated <a
href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/json/complex-modifications-manipulator-evaluation-priority/">here</a>
and reiterated <a
href="https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements/issues/808#issuecomment-358390814">here</a>,
Karabiner currently has a significant limitation - it overlooks rules
that are outlined following other existing rules, even if those rules
have unique conditions. For a more comprehensive explanation, refer to
this <a
href="https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements/issues/2774">feature
request</a>. Consequently, it is recommended to position the initial
revision, “Disable SpaceFN mode after last typing,” following all other
rules to prevent it from superseding the remaining rules.</p>
