<h1 id="spacefn-plus">SpaceFN Plus</h1>

<p>This is an upgraded version of SpaceFN. The existing SpaceFN
configuration unfavourably activates SpaceFN mode during rapid typing,
rendering it unusability. The concept is drawn from <a
href="https://spacelauncherapp.com">SpaceLauncher</a>, with two primary
revisions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Inhibit SpaceFN Mode for a duration of 0.2 seconds post the last
keystroke: This adjustment allows for the quick insertion of a space
following the completion of a word.</li>
<li>Ingore pre-defined keys within 0.2 seconds after space key down:
This enhancement aims to prevent a letter from being activated before
releasing the space bar during speedy typing.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been using these two <a

for 4 years, and they work well for me.</p>
