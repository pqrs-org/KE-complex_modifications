  Description
</p>
<p>
  While <button>CTRL + a</button> already works as "go to the beginning of the line"
  in PowerPoint by default, Microsoft decided that <button>CTRL + e</button> will be
  used to change text alignment of the current line to "center", which is unhelpful.
</p>
<p>
  With this complex mod, <button>CTRL + e</button> will now "go to the end of the line".
  That means both key combinations serve their Emacs-inspired purpose, balance is
  restored, and all's good with the world.
