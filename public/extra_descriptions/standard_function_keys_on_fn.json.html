<h2>Solution to profile dependent F key swap</h2>
<p>
	There are 3 rules:
	<ol>
	  <li>First make sure you use the media keys as default (checkbox off)* and assign F1 to F1 etc. in the Function Keys menu for given profile. Now after adding this rule and following these steps F keys will be the used primarily for this profile.</li>
	  <li>First make sure you use the media keys as default (checkbox off)*. Now after adding this rule ("Swap f key functions..") you avoid assignment F1 to F1 etc. like in the first rule. Drawback: causes Touch Bar to flicker when f keys are pressed (no problem with media function keys).</li>
	  <li>Best solution, allows fastest setup of a profile, but requires switching to F1, F2 as default (checkbox on)*. Now you will have F keys set as default so just select this third rule ("Keep normal media keys funtionality...") for the profiles, where you want to keep using media function keys as default. This is inverted method so to say.</li>
	</ol>
	*I mean checkbox on the bottom of Function Keys menu to use F1, F2 etc. as default.
