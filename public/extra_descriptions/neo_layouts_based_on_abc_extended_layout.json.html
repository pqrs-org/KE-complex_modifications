<h2>Neo2 layout</h2>
<p>Rules for the <a href='http://neo-layout.org/' target='_blank'>Neo2 keyboard layout</a>.</p>

<p>These modifications provide better shortcut support. However, due to using the ABC Extended layout,
  not all keys are implemented. Layer 5 and 6 are also missing, so in order to use those the other Neo2 modifications
  need to also enabled.
</p>

<p>
  Both modification sets can be enabled at the same time, by changing the layout between ABC Extended
  and the corresponding Neo layout.
</p>

To use a PC style keyboard, the following simple modifications need to be enabled:<br/><br/>

<pre>
grave_accent_and_tilde (`) -> non_us_backslash<br/>
non_us_backslash           -> grave_accent_and_tilde (`)<br/>
non_us_pound               -> backslash (\)<br/>
right_option               -> right_command
</pre>
