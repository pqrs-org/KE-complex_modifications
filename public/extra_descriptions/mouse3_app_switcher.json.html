<h4>Quick Application Switcher with Mouse Button 3</h4>

<p>Use Mouse Button 3(middle mouse button) to "Command-Tab" Switch
  Applications</p>

<h5>Motivation</h5>

<p>
    Occasionally it could be more convenient to rapidly switch
    between two apps with a simple click of the mouse button.
    This also allows such convenience as selection with the mouse while
    using common keyboard shortcuts (e.g. cut/copy/paste)

    (creator's side note: This was also spurred by a sense of
    repetitive use issues of using the Command+Tab key combination
    frequently)
</p>

<h5>How to use</h5>

<p>
    Use karabiner-elements to map the Mouse 3 (single click,
    does not repeat) to "Command-Tab" equivalent.
    Install this extension under tab 'Complex modifications'.
</p>

<p>
    Will only switch back and forth between two most recent Applications
